Description of Data:

The database was built with temporal 3-axial (in XYZ-axes) raw signals obtained from accelerometer (Acc) and gyroscope (Gyro) over a time period t. The signals were denoted as tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ, respectively. Both signal types were further separated into body and gravity signals, denoted as tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ, and tBodyGyro-XYZ and tGravityGyro-XYZ.
Jerk signals, tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ, were also derived based on the acceleration. Additionally, the magnitude (Mag) of the 3-dimensional signals were also calculated to obtain tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, and tBodyGyroJerkMag.
Fast fourier transform was performed to further obtain fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, and fBodyGyroJerkMag. f stands for frequency.

In summary, the measurements/variables are:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Based on these measurements, the mean value and standard deviation (std) were then estimated.
